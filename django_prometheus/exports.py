    its stack. This offers the advantage that even if Django becomes
    unable to respond, the HTTPServer will continue to function and
    export metrics. However, this also means that the features
    offered by Django (like middlewares or WSGI) can't be used.

    Now here's the really weird part. When Django runs with the
    auto-reloader enabled (which is the default, you can disable it
    with `manage.py runserver --noreload`), it forks and executes
    manage.py twice. That's wasteful but usually OK. It starts being a
    problem when you try to open a port, like we do. We can detect
    that we're running under an autoreloader through the presence of
    the RUN_MAIN environment variable, so we abort if we're trying to
    export under an autoreloader and trying to open a port.
